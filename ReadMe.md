# Technologies

## Frontend

-   **Frontend**: React, vite, React Router
-   **State Management**: React's `useState`, `useContextApi` `useEffect`, Formik, Yup
-   **Styling**: Bootstrap, React bootstrap, React toastify
-   **API Communication**: Axios or Fetch (for API requests)
-   **Form Validation**: Yup with Formik
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM

## Backend

-   **Backend Framework:** Express.js
-   **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose)-(Atlas)
-   **Environment Variables:** dotenv (configures environment-specific variables)
-   **Security:** Helmet (for HTTP header security)
-   **Rate Limiting:** express-rate-limit (limits the number of requests per IP)
-   **Logging:** Custom Logger Middleware (with logToFile function)
-   **CORS:** CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for handling cross-origin requests
-   **Routes:** Modular route handling for Products, Users, Carts, Orders, Discounts

## API Endpoints

-   **/api/users:** User-related API routes
-   **/api/carts:** Cart-related API routes
-   **/api/orders:** Order-related API routes
-   **/api/products:** Product-related API routes
-   **/api/discounts:** Discount and Offer-related API routes

## Development Tools

-   Chalk (for colored terminal output)
-   express-list-routes (for listing all routes)

## Key Features

-   **Environment Configuration**
    -   Based on the environment (production or development), different .env files are loaded to set up environment-specific configurations (e.g., DB connection, API keys).

# Rate Limiting

-   Implemented with the express-rate-limit middleware to limit the number of requests an IP can make within a 24-hour window. This helps prevent abuse and reduces the risk of DDoS attacks.

# Security

-   Using helmet middleware to enhance the security of HTTP headers and prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, etc.

# Logging

-   Custom logger middleware captures logs and writes them to a file for persistence and auditing.

# Modular Routes:

-   Routes are organized by resources (products, users, carts, orders, discounts), improving scalability and maintainability.

# CORS

-   CORS middleware ensures that the server can accept requests from different domains, facilitating smooth integration between the frontend and backend.

# MongoDB with Mongoose

-   Mongoose is used to handle database connections and schema definitions for MongoDB, making data interactions more seamless and easier to manage.

# Route Listing in Development Mode

-   In development mode, all routes in the Express app are logged to the console using the express-list-routes package, providing an overview of available routes.

# Server

-   The Express server listens on a port, and depending on the environment, it will either run in development or production mode, adjusting its behavior accordingly.
